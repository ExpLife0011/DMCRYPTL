# PUBGDL
Decrypts memory within PUBG using special black magic techniques
  
# USAGE
Usage of this library is up to you. You will have to implement it with whatever technique for read/write you have available.  
  
The test.cpp file includes a test you can run, that shows decrypting of a EncryptedBlock that I've pre-dumped from memory, and stored in a static buffer.

## DISCLAIMER
I'll try to keep this up to date, no promises! Keeping this high of quality up to date, while already being busy is difficult. I don't even write my cheats in a native language!
